Interactive web app can be found here: https://jeffreyd.shinyapps.io/crashes/

Published app is limited to 2019 to 2021 and randomly samples 20,000 points from the full data due to the limitations of Shiny web apps. 

`crashes-full` omits this feature if you wish to run it in RStudio (map function may not load, comment out to avoid issues).
